## Description
The objective was to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected. This app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I have written. It has a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, and it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
